Free C++ course outline
=======================


Hello world
----------
- helloWorld.cpp
- Introduction on how to write a simple program that outputs the string “hello
world” to the screen.


Selection
---------
 - ifAndElseWCin.cpp
 - Shows how to use if and else clauses in cpp. The input by the user is obtained using the cin method.
 - ifAndElseWStringStream.cpp
 - Shows how to use if and else clauses in cpp. The input by the user is obtained using the cin method. Stringstream is used to separate data and user input.


Variable Types
-------------
- intEx.cpp
- Shows how to use int variables in a program that makes simple calculations
- floatEx.cpp
- Shows how to use float variables in a program that makes simple calculations.
- arrEx.cpp
- Show to declare simple arrays in C++. The program also shows to make simple
  calculations using arrays.
- vectorEx.cpp
- Shows how to declare simple vectors in C++. It also shows how to use simple 
  vectors to make calucations.
- simpleStructEx.cpp
- Example that shows to declare simple structs in C++.
- structArrEx.cpp
- Example that shows how to declare arrays of simple structs in c++.
- simplStringEx.cpp
- Simple example of how to use and declare strings in C++

Loops
-----
- forExample.cpp 
- Shows to print five lines of “Hello World” using a for loop
- whileEx.cpp
- Shows how to use a while loop to wait for a user to enter a certain character.
- doWhileEx.cpp
- Shows how to use a do while loop to generate two random numbers in a vector.

Pointer
-------
- intPtr.cpp
- Program that shows how to use pointers with regards to integers.
- floatPtrFunc.cpp
- Show to use a float pointer and function to calcuate the area of circle
- charPtrEx.cpp
- Show how to use a char pointer and a function to change a character from lower to upperCase
- ptrToCharVector.cpp
- Shows to use a function and a char pointer to convert the letters stored in char array from lowerCase to upperCase

Simple objects
--------------
- circle.cpp
- A program that represent a circle. Methods to make simple calculations upon a circle.
- square.cpp
- A program that represents a square. Methods to make simple calculations upon a square.

Simple multiple inheritance
-----------------------------------------
- bikeClassesMultipInherit.cpp
-	A program that shows to accomplish simple multiple inheritance.
	 The inheritance structure is as follows:
	 a sub class of bike such as racing bike inherits the main classes bike and storeItem.
	 The main class bike represent the basic properties of a bike. The subclass racing bikes
	 adds properties that may be important to represent a racing bike such as top speed. 
	The class storeItem represent an item sold in this example in a sporting goods store such with properties such as article number, shelf placement and so on.
	
Sorting
-----------------------------------------
- bubbleSortEx.cpp
- 	A program that lets the user enter 4 to 25 integers, The numbers are then sorted using the algorrithm called bobbleSort.
