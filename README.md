Free C++ course outline
=======================


Hello world
----------
- helloWorld.cpp
- Introduction on how to write a simple program that outputs the string “hello
world” to the screen.


Selection
---------
 - ifAndElseWCin.cpp
 - Shows how to use if and else clauses in cpp. The input by the user is obtained using the cin method.
 - ifAndElseWStringStream.cpp
 - Shows how to use if and else clauses in cpp. The input by the user is obtained using the cin method. Stringstream is used to separate data and user input.


Variable Types
-------------
- intEx.cpp
- Shows how to use int variables in a program that makes simple calculations
- floatEx.cpp
- Shows how to use float variables in a program that makes simple calculations.
- arrEx.cpp
- Show to declare simple arrays in C++. The program also shows to make simple
  calculations using arrays.
- vectorEx.cpp
- Shows how to declare simple vectors in C++. It also shows how to use simple 
  vectors to make calucations.
- simpleStructEx.cpp
- Example that shows to declare simple structs in C++.
- structArrEx.cpp
- Example that shows how to declare arrays of simple structs in c++.

Loops
-----
- forExample.cpp 
- Shows to print five lines of “Hello World” using a for loop
- whileEx.cpp
- Shows how to use a while loop to wait for a user to enter a certain character.
- doWhileEx.cpp
- Shows how to use a do while loop to generate two random numbers in a vector.

Pointer
-------
- intPtr.cpp
- Program that shows how to use pointers with regards to integers.
- floatPtrFunc.cpp
- Show to use a float pointer and function to calcuate the area of circle
- charPtrEx.cpp
- Show how to use a char pointer and a function to change a character from lower to upperCase
- ptrToCharVector.cpp
- Shows to use a function and a char pointer to convert the letters stored in char array from lowerCase to upperCase

Simple objects
--------------
 - Circle
 - circle.cpp
 - Square
 - square.cpp
 - Romb
 - Triangle
 - Cone


Bike, instances of several types of bikes
-----------------------------------------
 - Classes constructors
 - Classes Destructor
 - /u*Classes simple inthertiance
 - /u*Classes multiple inheritance
 - Class friendship
 - Classes polymorphism
 - Simple overloading
 - Possibly templates?
 - File i/O
 - Simple system programming in Linux?


Threads?
========
 -  Using commandline argument argc. Argv for example to tell a cpp program how many units of
memeory to allocate for a vector containning floats for examples.
